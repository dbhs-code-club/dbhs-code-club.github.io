    <h2>What is Code Club?</h2>
    Code Club (C<sup>2</sup>) is an organization at 
    <a href="http://dbhs.org">Diamond Bar High School</a> where members can 
    expand their coding skills and interests. 

    <h2>Who is welcome?</h2>
    Everyone who has an interest in coding or computer science may join. 
    Although not everyone ought to be a programmer, we encourage people to try 
    and see if you like this stuff. 

    <h2>What will we do?</h2>
    <p>
    We are planning to hold workshops weekly in the coming school year. Topics 
    include Capture the Flag (CTFs), computer science, and web development. We
    will also participate together (or individually) in 
    <a href="http://inctf.in/ctf/what.html">CTFs</a> and hackathons.
